    Run Monte Carlo simulation to predict race finish times with uncertainty.

    This is the core prediction engine that accounts for:
    1. Day-to-day performance variability
    2. Grade-specific pace uncertainty
    3. Weather and feeling adjustments
    4. Progressive fatigue throughout the race

    Args:
        legs_meters: Distance covered in each grade bin for each leg (2D array)
                    Shape: (n_legs, n_grade_bins)
        speeds_mps: Base speeds for each grade bin (meters per second)
        sigmas_rel: Relative uncertainty for each grade bin (coefficient of variation)
        leg_ends_x: Fractional progress at each checkpoint (0.0 to 1.0)
        heat: Weather condition ("cool", "moderate", "hot")
        feel: How runner feels ("good", "ok", "meh")
        sims: Number of Monte Carlo simulations to run
        sigma_day: Day-to-day performance variability (e.g., 0.05 = 5%)
        rho: Correlation between grade bins (0 to 1)

    Returns:
        Tuple of (p10, p90) - 10th and 90th percentile times for each checkpoint

    Simulation Process:
    1. Each simulation draws a "day factor" (good day vs bad day)
    2. Grade-specific speeds are adjusted with correlated noise
    3. Each leg's time is calculated considering:
       - Distance at each grade
       - Adjusted speed for each grade
       - Progressive fatigue
       - Weather/feeling multipliers
    4. Percentiles are extracted from all simulations
